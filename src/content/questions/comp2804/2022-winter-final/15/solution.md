Mathematical Proof for $P(A \cap B) < P(A) \cdot P(B)$

Here is the mathematical explanation for why: $P(A \cap B) < P(A) P(B)$, where

- $A: \pi_{10} > \pi_{11}$
- $B: \pi_{11} > \pi_{12}$

This setup involves a **random permutation** of a sequence of 20 distinct numbers.

## **1. Understanding the Probabilities of the Events**

### **Probability of Event A and Event B**

Event $A$ asks whether the value at position 10 is greater than the value at position 11 in a random permutation.
In a **random permutation**, every ordering of the numbers is equally likely. Between two random positions (like 10 and 11), thereâ€™s a **50% chance** one is greater than the other.

Thus, $P(A) = \frac{1}{2}$

Similarly, the probability that the value at position 11 is greater than the value at position 12 is also: $P(B) = \frac{1}{2}$

## **2. Joint Probability of P intersect B**

The event $A \cap B$ means: $\pi*{10} > \pi*{11}$ and $\pi*{11} > \pi*{12}$. This means that the sequence at positions 10, 11, and 12 is **strictly decreasing**.

In a random permutation of 20 elements, there are: $\binom{20}{3} \cdot 3!$ ways to select 3 positions (e.g., 10, 11, 12) and arrange them in any order. There are exactly **1 arrangement** (out of $3! = 6$) where the sequence is strictly decreasing.

Thus, the probability is: $P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{6}$

## **3. Compare P intersect B with P(A)P(B)**

Using the values: $P(A)P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$

And we found: $P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{6}$

Comparing the two: $\frac{1}{6} < \frac{1}{4}$, which means we can conclude that $P(A \cap B) < P(A) P(B)$.
