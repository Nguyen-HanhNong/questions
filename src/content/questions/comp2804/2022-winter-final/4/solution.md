## Method to Solve Problem

The problem asks to find the number of strings of length 70 that can be formed using the characters $ \{a, b, c, d, e\} $, where each character can be repeated that have at least 10 'a's. The use of "at least" in the problem statement suggests that we can use the **complement principle** to simplify the counting process.

## **Total Number of Strings**

Each character in the string can be chosen from the set $ \{a, b, c, d, e\} $ (5 choices per character). Therefore, the **total number of possible strings of length 70** is: $5^{70}$

## **Strings with Fewer than 10 'a's**

We can use the **complement principle**. Instead of directly counting strings with **at least 10 'a's**, we count the strings with **fewer than 10 'a's** (0 to 9 'a's) and subtract from the total.

To count strings with exactly $ i $ occurrences of 'a' (where $ i = 0, 1, \ldots, 9 $):

- Choose $ i $ positions for 'a': $ \binom{70}{i} $
- Fill the remaining $ 70 - i $ positions with the other 4 characters (b, c, d, e): $ 4^{70-i} $

Using the **binomial theorem**, the total number of strings with fewer than 10 'a's is: $\sum\_{i=0}^{9} \binom{70}{i} \cdot 4^{70-i}$

## **3. Apply the Complement Principle**

The number of strings with **at least 10 'a's** is: $ 5^{70} - \sum\_{i=0}^{9} \binom{70}{i} \cdot 4^{70-i}$
