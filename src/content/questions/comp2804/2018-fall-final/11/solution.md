## **Answer by Observation**

Each flip of a fair coin has two equally likely outcomes:

- $ H $ (Heads)
- $ T $ (Tails)

When flipping 5 coins:

- The total number of possible outcomes is: $2^5 = 32$
- Half of these outcomes will have an **odd number of heads**, and the other half will have an **even number of heads**.

### **Why Are They Evenly Split?**

- For every outcome with an **odd number of heads**, there is a corresponding outcome with an **even number of heads** by flipping one coin from heads to tails (or vice versa).
- This creates a **1-to-1 correspondence** between odd and even outcomes.

Thus, the probability of an **odd number of heads** is: $P(\text{Odd number of heads}) = \frac{1}{2}$
