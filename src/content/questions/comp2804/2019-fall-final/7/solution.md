Given the fact that we all have multiple unknown variables that we need to solve for that will all have to sum to a specific numbers, we can use the formula from "Counting Solutions of Linear Equations" or Chapter 3.9.2 in the textbook to solve this problem: $\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$

Let $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7$ be the number of bananas Nick eats on each day: $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 = 25$

In this case, let $n$ represent the number of bananas Nick eats and $k$ represent the number of days/number of unknown variables. Therefore, $n = 25$ and $k = 7$. Now we can invoke the formula to solve for the number of solutions:

$\binom{25+7-1}{7-1} = \binom{31}{6}$
